License notice for Iosevka font
-------------------------------

This software includes a custom build of Iosevka, which is available under the
SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

Copyright (c) 2015-2022 Renzhi Li

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s)
    under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source
    files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
    statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
    substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the Original
    Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other
    person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and
sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original
   or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains
   the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
   stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
   machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
   fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s)
   unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright
   Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented
   to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software
   shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version,
   except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the
   Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
   distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under
   any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
   does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR
OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR
FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
